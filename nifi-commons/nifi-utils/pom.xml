    <description>
        This nifi-utils module should be a general purpose place to store widely
        and generally useful functions that any component might want to leverage.
        NO DEPENDENCIES should be added.  This module is likely to be leveraged by
        every extension and should not bring along any other dependencies.  The only
        dependency intended is the nifi-api and even this is expected to be already
        provided in any case where it would  be used.  The typical place this util
        would be found is within a nar and all nars already have nifi-api as a parent
        dependency.  The nifi-api can be thought of as a NiFi Application Container level
        dependency.
