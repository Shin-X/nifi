<h2>Best practices to handle multiple signal ids at a Wait processor</h2>

When a Wait processor is expected to process multiple signal ids, by configuring 'Release Signal Identifier' with a FlowFile attribute Expression Language, there are few things to consider in order to get the expected result. Processor configuration can vary based on your requirement.

Also, you will need to have high level understanding on how Wait processor works:
<ul>
	<li>Wait processor only process a single signal id at a time</li>
	<li>How frequent Wait processor runs is defined at 'Run Schedule'</li>
	<li>Which FlowFile is processed is determined by Prioritizer</li>
	<li>Not limited to Wait processor, but for all processors, the order of queued FlowFiles in a connection is undefined if no Prioritizer is set</li>
</ul>


See following sections for common patterns
<ul>
	<li><a href="#asap">Release any FlowFile as soon as its signal is notified</a></li>
	<li><a href="#higher-priority">Release higher priority FlowFiles in each signal id</a></li>
</ul>

<h3 id="asap">Release any FlowFile as soon as its signal is notified</h3>

This is the most common use case.
FlowFiles are independent and can be released in any order.

<h4>Important configurations:</h4>
<ul>
	<li>Use FirstInFirstOutPrioritizer (FIFO) at 'wait' relationship (or the incoming connection if 'Wait Mode' is 'Keep in the upstream connection)</li>
</ul>

The following table illustrates the notified signal ids, queued FlowFiles and what will happen at each Wait run cycle.

<table>
	<tbody>
	<tr>
		<th># of Wait run</th>
		<th>Notified Signals</th>
		<th>Queue Index (FIFO)</th>
		<th>FlowFile UUID</th>
		<th>Signal ID</th>
		<th>&nbsp;</th>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td rowspan="3">1</td>
		<td rowspan="3">B</td>
		<td>1</td>
		<td>a</td>
		<td>A</td>
		<td>This FlowFile is processed. But its signal is not found, and will be re-queued at the end of the queue.</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td>2</td>
		<td>b</td>
		<td>B</td>
		<td>&nbsp;</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td>3</td>
		<td>c</td>
		<td>C</td>
		<td>&nbsp;</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td rowspan="3">2</td>
		<td rowspan="3">B</td>
		<td>1</td>
		<td>b</td>
		<td>B</td>
		<td>This FlowFile is processed and since its signal is notified, this one will be released to 'success'.</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td>2</td>
		<td>c</td>
		<td>C</td>
		<td>&nbsp;</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td>3</td>
		<td>a</td>
		<td>A</td>
		<td>&nbsp;</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td rowspan="3">3</td>
		<td rowspan="3">&nbsp;</td>
		<td>1</td>
		<td>c</td>
		<td>C</td>
		<td>This FlowFile will be processed at the next run.</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td>2</td>
		<td>a</td>
		<td>A</td>
		<td>&nbsp;</td>
	</tr>
	</tbody>
</table>



<h3 id="higher-priority">Release higher priority FlowFiles in each signal id</h3>

Multiple FlowFiles share the same signal id, and the order of releasing a FlowFile is important.

<h4>Important configurations:</h4>
<ul>
	<li>Use a (or set of a) Prioritizer(s) suites your need other than FIFO, at 'wait' relationship (or the incoming connection if 'Wait Mode' is 'Keep in the upstream connection), e.g. PriorityPrioritizer</li>
	<li>Specify adequate 'Wait Penalty Duration', e.g. "3 sec", </li>
	<li>'Wait Penalty Duration' should be grater than 'Run Schedule', e.g "3 sec" > "1 sec"</li>
	<li>Increase 'Run Duration' to avoid the limitation of number of signal ids (see the <a href="#run-duration">note</a> below)</li>
</ul>

The following table illustrates the notified signal ids, queued FlowFiles and what will happen at each Wait run cycle.
The example uses PriorityPrioritizer to control the order of processing FlowFiles within a signal id.

If 'Wait Penalty Duration' is configured, Wait processor tracks unreleased signal ids and their penalty representing when they will be checked again.

<table>
	<tbody>
	<tr>
		<th># of Wait run</th>
		<th>Notified Signals</th>
		<th>Signal Penalties</th>
		<th>Queue Index (via 'priority' attribute)</th>
		<th>FlowFile UUID</th>
		<th>Signal ID</th>
		<th>'priority' attr</th>
		<th>&nbsp;</th>

		<td>This FlowFile is processed. But its signal is not found. Penalized.</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td>2</td>
		<td>b-1</td>
		<td>B</td>
		<td>1</td>
		<td>Since a-1 and b-1 have the same priority '1', b-1 may be processed before a-1. You can add another Prioritizer to define more specific ordering.</td>
	</tr>

<h4 id="run-duration">The importance of 'Run Duration' when 'Wait Penalty Duration' is used</h4>

<p>
There are limitation of number of signals can be checked based on the combination of 'Run Schedule' and 'Wait Penalize Duration'.
If this limitation is engaged, some FlowFiles may not be processed and remain in the 'wait' relationship even if their signal ids are notified.
Let's say Wait is configured with:
</p>

<ul>
	<li>Run Schedule = 1 sec</li>
	<li>Wait Penalize Duration = 3 sec</li>
	<li>Release Signal Identifier = ${uuid}</li>
</ul>

<p>
And there are 5 FlowFiles F1, F2 ... F5 in the 'wait' relationship.
Then the signal for F5 is notified.
Wait will work as follows:
</p>

<ul>
	<li>At 00:00 Wait checks the signal for F1, not found, and penalize F1 (till 00:03)</li>
	<li>At 00:01 Wait checks the signal for F2, not found, and penalize F2 (till 00:04)</li>
	<li>At 00:02 Wait checks the signal for F3, not found, and penalize F3 (till 00:05)</li>
	<li>At 00:03 Wait checks the signal for F4, not found, and penalize F4 (till 00:06)</li>
	<li>At 00:04 Wait checks the signal for F1 again, because it's not penalized any longer</li>
</ul>
Repeat above cycle, thus F5 will not be released until one of F1 ... F4 is released.

<p>
To mitigate such limitation, increasing 'Run Duration' is recommended. By increasing 'Run Duration', Wait processor can keep being scheduled for that duration. For example, with 'Run Duration' 500 ms, Wait should be able to loop through all 5 queued FlowFiles at a single run.
