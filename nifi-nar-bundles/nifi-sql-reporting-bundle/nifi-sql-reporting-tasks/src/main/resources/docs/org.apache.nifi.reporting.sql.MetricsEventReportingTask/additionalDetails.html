<h2>Summary</h2>
<p>
    This reporting task can be used to issue SQL queries against various NiFi metrics information,  submit returned data to a rules engine (which will determine if any actions should be performed)
    and execute the prescribed actions using action handlers. This task requires a RulesEngineService (which will identify any actions that should be performed) and an ActionHandler which will execute the action(s).
    A distinct ActionHandler can be used to service all events or an ActionHandlerLookup can be used for dynamic handler lookup. NOTE: Optimally action handler should be associated with the expected action types
    returned from the rules engine.
