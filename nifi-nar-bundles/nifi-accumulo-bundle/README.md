# nifi-accumulo

This is a basic NiFi->Accumulo integration. Running `mvn install` will create your NAR, which can be added
to Apache NiFi. This is intended to be created with Apache Accumulo 2.x.

The resulting NAR will be named 'nifi-accumulo-nar'


Note that some of this code was modeled after the HBase work.
