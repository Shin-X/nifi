/**
 * Indicates the scope of expression language on a property descriptor.
 *
 * Scope of the expression language is hierarchical.
 *      NONE -> VARIABLE_REGISTRY -> FLOWFILE_ATTRIBUTES
 *
 * When scope is set to FlowFiles attributes, variables are evaluated
 * against attributes of each incoming flow file. If no matching attribute
 * is found, variable registry will be checked.
 *
 * NONE - expression language is not supported
 *
 * VARIABLE_REGISTRY is hierarchically constructed as below:
 *  |---- Variables defined at process group level and then, recursively, up
 *  |     to the higher process group until the root process group.
 *  |--- Variables defined in custom properties files through the
 *  |    nifi.variable.registry.properties property in nifi.properties file.
 *  |-- Environment variables defined at JVM level and system properties.
 *
 * FLOWFILE_ATTRIBUTES - will check attributes of each individual flow file
